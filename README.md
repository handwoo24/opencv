### next-opencv

 - [opencv](https://docs.opencv.org/4.8.0/)

opencv is very powerful image processing module

i write thie module for using opencv in react

but opencv interface is too large to write all methods and attributes

i hope to write everythings about opencv

### how
```
const Components = () => {
  ...
  const cv = useCv(version) // default is 4.8.0
  ...

  return <>
    ...
  </>
}
```
